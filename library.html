    A library is a curated collection of sources of information and similar resources,
    selected by experts and made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing, 
    often in a quiet environment conducive to study [1] [2]. It provides physical or digital 
    access to material, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's 
    collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, 
    documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks,
     databases, and other formats. Libraries range widely in size up to millions of items.
      In Latin and Greek, the idea of a bookcase is represented by Bibliotheca and Bibliothēkē 
      (Greek: βιβλιοθήκη): derivatives of these mean library in many modern languages, e.g. 
      French bibliothèque. <br><br>

    The first libraries consisted of archives of the earliest form of writing—the clay 
    tablets in cuneiform script discovered in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC. 
    Private or personal libraries made up of written books appeared in classical 
    Greece in the 5th century BC. In the 6th century, at the very close of the 
    Classical period, the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained
     those of Constantinople and Alexandria. The libraries of Timbuktu were also 
     established around this time and attracted scholars from all over the world. <br><br>
    
    A library is organized for use and maintained by a public body, an institution,
     a corporation, or a private individual. Public and institutional collections
     and services may be intended for use by people who choose not to—or cannot 
     afford to—purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need material no 
     individual can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional
      assistance with their research. In addition to providing materials, libraries
       also provide the services of librarians who are experts at finding and organizing
        information and at interpreting information needs. Libraries often provide quiet
         areas for studying, and they also often offer common areas to facilitate group 
         study and collaboration. Libraries often provide public facilities for access to
          their electronic resources and the Internet. <br><br>
    
    Modern libraries are increasingly being redefined as places to get unrestricted 
    access to information in many formats and from many sources. They are extending
     services beyond the physical walls of a building, by providing material accessible
      by electronic means, and by providing the assistance of librarians in navigating 
      and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of digital resources.
       Libraries are increasingly becoming community hubs where programs are delivered and
        people engage in lifelong learning. <br>
